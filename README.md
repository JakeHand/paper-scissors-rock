# Paper Scissors Rock
In this program I made a paper scissors rock game that you can play against the computer. Simply pick your choice of rock, paper or scissors and the computer will strategically (randomly) make a choice in response.

The hardest part I found creating this project was the logic of how the project would work. I would create what was needed to fulfil a part of the program, just to find that to proceed through the next step of logic I would need to alter the previous segment I had just created. 

This project showed me that I should probably create some sort of plan for the logical process of my projects before beginning them.
